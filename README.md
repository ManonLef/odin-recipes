Hi there,

After a bit of a break I had to refresh my memory on the html and css part. 
So I took a shot at the recipe page from The Odin Project.

I drew up some quick gifs to accompany the made up recipes to not go through the hassle of looking up usage rights from someone else's work.

If you ended up here doing a TOP project for yourself as well;
Feel free to use my recipes and images from this project for your own personal use.

(I might add more recipe pages in the future that are free to copy)
